# Local Development Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project on your macOS machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your macOS:

*   **Node.js and npm:** You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)). npm is included with Node.js.

## Setup Steps

1.  **Extract the project files:** Extract the contents of the `app_files.zip` file that you transferred to your macOS machine. You can do this using the built-in Archive Utility or by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
unzip app_files.zip
```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal and change your current directory to the extracted project folder:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```
(Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project folder.)

3.  **Install dependencies:** Once in the project directory, install the project's dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the necessary packages.

4.  **Run the application:** After the dependencies are installed, you can run the application. The specific command to run the application might vary depending on the project's `package.json` scripts, but commonly used commands are:
```bash
npm start
    # or
    npm run dev
```
Check the `scripts` section in the `package.json` file to confirm the correct command for starting the development server.

5.  **Access the application:** Once the development server is running, you should see a message in your terminal indicating the address where you can access the application (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Open your web browser and go to that address.

That's it! You should now have the application running locally on your macOS machine.
